# Common ActionScript Errors

This repository demonstrates two common errors encountered when working with ActionScript:

1. **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:** Accessing an array element beyond its bounds.
2. **ReferenceError:** Attempting to access a non-existent property of an object.

The `bug.as` file contains code exhibiting these errors. The `bugSolution.as` file provides corrected code and explanations. 

## How to Run

1.  Install an ActionScript compiler (e.g., the Adobe Flash Professional IDE or a command-line compiler like ASC2).
2.  Compile and run the `bug.as` and `bugSolution.as` files within your chosen ActionScript environment.
